## Explainable AI for Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

SmartCare AI is a group-based Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning project developed to predict whether a patient is likely to **attend or miss a scheduled healthcare appointment**.

The project implements an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data understanding, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and Explainable AI using SHAP.

## 📌 Project Overview

Missed medical appointments can negatively affect healthcare resource utilization, appointment scheduling, and service efficiency.

SmartCare AI aims to address this problem by developing machine learning models that learn patterns from historical healthcare appointment data and predict the likelihood of a patient being a **no-show**.

In addition to prediction, the project focuses on **Explainable AI (XAI)** to understand why a model makes a particular prediction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand and analyse a healthcare appointment dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for machine learning.
- Perform meaningful feature engineering.
- Explore relationships between patient and appointment characteristics.
- Develop and compare multiple classification models.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluate models using appropriate classification metrics.
- Select the best-performing model.
- Apply SHAP for Explainable AI.
- Provide global and local explanations for model predictions.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a healthcare appointment dataset containing patient, appointment, medical, laboratory, admission, and financial-related information.

The dataset contains **1,000 records** and multiple attributes used to identify patterns associated with appointment attendance.

### Example Feature Categories

- Patient information
- Appointment information
- Previous appointment history
- Blood pressure measurements
- Laboratory information
- Admission information
- Financial information
- Previous appointment behaviour

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing stage includes:

- Missing value handling
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Outlier detection using the IQR method
- Feature engineering
- Categorical feature encoding
- Feature scaling
- Feature selection

Examples of engineered information include:

- Age groups
- High blood pressure indicators
- Previous appointment behaviour
- Previous missed appointment information

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand:

- Dataset distributions
- Target class distribution
- Numerical feature relationships
- Categorical feature patterns
- Correlations
- Potential outliers
- Relationships between appointment behaviour and the target variable

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Five classification algorithms were developed and compared.

### 1. Logistic Regression
An interpretable linear classification model used as a baseline and for understanding feature relationships.

### 2. Decision Tree
A tree-based model capable of learning non-linear decision boundaries.

### 3. Random Forest
An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve robustness and predictive performance.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A distance-based algorithm that predicts a class based on neighbouring observations.

### 5. XGBoost
A gradient boosting algorithm used to evaluate an advanced ensemble learning approach.

---

## ⚙️ Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets using a stratified split:

```python
train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.20,
    random_state=42,
    stratify=y
)
```

### Why `stratify=y`?

Stratification helps maintain a similar distribution of target classes in both the training and testing datasets.

### GridSearchCV

`GridSearchCV` was used to search for suitable hyperparameter combinations.

The tuning process uses:

**5-Fold Cross-Validation**

This allows different parameter combinations to be evaluated across multiple validation folds.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curves
- Training vs Testing Performance
- Overfitting Analysis

![Model Performance Comparison](assets/model_comparison.png)

---

## 🏆 Best Performing Model

Based on the current test-set evaluation, **Logistic Regression** achieved the strongest overall performance among the evaluated models.

| Metric | Score |
|---|---:|
| Accuracy | **63.00%** |
| F1-Score | **0.6300** |
| ROC-AUC | **0.6709** |

The Logistic Regression model was selected as the best-performing model for the current experimental setup.

> **Note:** These results are based on the current dataset and experimental configuration and should not be interpreted as clinical performance.

---

## 🔎 Explainable AI (SHAP)

SmartCare AI uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to understand how individual features contribute to model predictions.

SHAP helps answer:

> **Why did the model make this prediction?**

### 🌍 Global Explainability

Global SHAP analysis identifies features with the greatest overall influence on predictions.

Important features identified through the analysis include:

- `waiting_days`
- `missed_previous_appointments`
- `previous_appointments`
- `admitted`
- `lab_charge_lkr`
- `total_bill_lkr`
- `lab_tests_count`

### 👤 Local Explainability

Local SHAP explanations are used to explain an individual patient's prediction.

A SHAP waterfall plot shows how individual feature values contribute toward a particular prediction.

streamlit run app.py
```

This opens the SmartCare AI web app, where a patient's details can be entered to generate a no-show prediction along with a live SHAP-based explanation.

---

## 🔐 Data Leakage Prevention

Data leakage prevention was considered throughout the machine learning workflow.

The dataset was split before final model evaluation:

```python
train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.20,
    random_state=42,
    stratify=y
)
```

Cross-validation is used during hyperparameter tuning so that model selection does not rely on the final test set.
